# Sprite Matrix Pipeline

Given a Daz Studio scene with one sprite already loaded (a specific outfit,
A-pose) and a JSON spec describing a matrix of pose x expression
combinations, this pipeline renders front and over-the-shoulder (back)
camera angles for every combo, then stylizes each render into a
"graphic-novel naturalism" look via ComfyUI.

## How it works

1. **Render stage** (`render_stage.py`): for each combo, restores the scene
   to a pristine baseline, applies the named pose preset + named expression
   preset + any per-combo overrides, then renders the beauty image plus
   Normal and Depth Iray Canvas passes (AOVs) from both cameras.
2. **Stylize stage** (`stylize_stage.py`): converts the Normal/Depth EXR
   canvases to PNG, derives a Canny/lineart pass from the beauty render, and
   submits a single ComfyUI img2img workflow conditioned on all three passes
   plus a fixed checkpoint/LoRA, so pose/structure stays locked to the Daz
   render while the graphic-novel look comes from Stable Diffusion. All
   three passes are conditioned through a single SDXL **union** ControlNet
   model (e.g. `controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0.safetensors`), loaded once and
   re-tagged per pass via ComfyUI's `SetUnionControlNetType` node (`normal`,
   `depth`, `canny/lineart/anime_lineart/mlsd`) -- not three separate
   per-type models. This is now a single full-image KSampler pass; there is
   no second pass over the image.
3. **Lineart composite** (post-process, `canvas_convert.multiply_blend`,
   tunable via `comfyui.lineart_composite_opacity` in the spec /
   `--lineart-composite-opacity` for `render_shot.py`): after the ComfyUI
   pass returns the color-stylized image, the same Canny lineart PNG already
   derived for the ControlNet pass above is multiply-blended back over it at
   a configurable opacity (`0` = no compositing, `1` = fully multiplied).
   This punches the ink linework back up where the diffusion pass softened
   it, without needing any extra model or a second sampling pass.

   This replaced an earlier two-pass mechanism (SEGSDetailer + IPAdapter
   FaceID) that re-ran the sampler on just the detected face region to keep
   small faces recognizable. That approach turned out to be the source of
   its own visible artifacts -- pale/ghostlike skin and harsh eye-shadow on
   the refined face -- confirmed via a live test with the face pass forced
   off (a zero-baseline run) that reproduced a clean face without those
   artifacts. Since the face-refinement mechanism was implicated rather than
   any of the shared conditioning, it was removed outright rather than
   further tuned, in favor of the simpler single-pass + deterministic
   lineart composite described above.

### Single-shot variant (`render_shot.py`)

For a one-off render -- no combo matrix, no pose/expression preset library,
no JSON spec -- use `render_shot.py` instead of `main.py`. It assumes the
pose and expression are already set up by hand in the live scene and starts
directly at the render step:

```bash
python render_shot.py --name shot001 --output-dir C:/output/hero_sprites --dry-run

python render_shot.py --name shot001 --output-dir C:/output/hero_sprites \
    --checkpoint graphicNovelStyleXL.safetensors --lora-name gn_ink_v2.safetensors \
    --controlnet-model controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0.safetensors
```

All spec fields (resolution, engine, quality preset, camera labels, ComfyUI
checkpoint/LoRA/ControlNet models and weights, prompts) are plain CLI flags
instead -- run `python render_shot.py --help` for the full list. `--camera
front|back|both` (default `both`), `--stage all|render|stylize`, `--force`,
and `--dry-run` work the same as `main.py`. Outputs land in the same
`<output_dir>/renders/<name>/...` / `<output_dir>/stylized/<name>/...`
layout as the batch pipeline (with `<name>` in place of `<combo_id>`), so a
one-off shot and a batch run can safely share an `output_dir`, and both are
resumable the same way (skip if the output file already exists).

Both stages are resumable: before doing any unit of work (one combo x one
camera x one stage) they check whether the output file already exists and
skip if so. There is no separate manifest -- a plain rerun of the same
command is self-healing after a crash or partial failure.

## Prerequisites

- DAZ Studio running with the DazScriptServer plugin, and the sprite scene
  already open (outfit loaded, in A-pose). The pipeline does **not** load
  the scene file itself -- `dazpy`'s `Scene.load()` is merge-mode (adds to
  the current scene rather than replacing it), so calling it automatically
  risks duplicating the figure.
- The scene must contain two named cameras for front and back/OTS shots
  (see `cameras.front.label` / `cameras.back.label` in the spec).
- A running ComfyUI instance with your graphic-novel-style checkpoint, LoRA,
  and an SDXL union ControlNet model (e.g. `controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0.safetensors`)
  installed -- one model conditions all three passes (normal, depth,
  lineart) via ComfyUI's `SetUnionControlNetType` node.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (plus `dazpy` itself). No ComfyUI custom
  nodes beyond the standard ControlNet/SDXL nodes are required -- the
  lineart composite step is a plain post-process done in Python, not a
  ComfyUI graph node.

## Authoring pose and expression presets

Presets are captured by hand, once, ahead of a batch run:

```bash
# Pose the character by hand in the live Daz Studio session, then:
python author_pose_preset.py --name standing_neutral --figure "Genesis 9" --library C:/presets/poses

# Dial in a facial expression by hand (body pose is untouched), then:
python author_expression_preset.py --name calm --figure "Genesis 9" --library C:/presets/expressions
```

Pose presets are plain `dazpy.DazPose` JSON (bones + morphs + props).
Expression presets are a parallel type that only stores morph values, so
applying an expression never disturbs the body pose applied just before it.

## Spec JSON schema

See `example_spec.json` for a full example. Key fields:

- `scene_path` -- documentation/logging only; the pipeline does not load it.
- `sprite.figure_label` -- the figure's label in the Daz scene (e.g.
  `"Genesis 9"`).
- `output_dir`, `pose_library_dir`, `expression_library_dir` -- relative
  paths are resolved against the spec file's directory.
- `cameras.front.label` / `cameras.back.label` -- must match camera node
  labels already present in the scene.
- `render` -- resolution, engine, Iray quality preset, and which canvases
  (AOVs) to render (`Normal`, `Depth`).
- `comfyui` -- checkpoint, LoRA, denoise, base seed, steps, cfg, prompts,
  `controlnet` (a single union `model` shared by all three passes plus
  per-pass `normal`/`depth`/`lineart` `weight`), and
  `lineart_composite_opacity` -- the post-process multiply-blend strength
  of the Canny lineart pass back over the color-stylized output (see
  "Lineart composite" above; `0` = no compositing, `1` = fully multiplied;
  default `1.0`). This replaced the old `face_detailer` block and its eight
  identity-pass knobs, which no longer exist -- see "Lineart composite"
  above for why that mechanism was removed rather than kept as an option.
- `combos` -- an explicit list of `{pose, expression, overrides?, id?}`
  entries (not a pose x expression cross product). `pose` and `expression`
  must resolve to files in the preset libraries. `overrides` is an optional
  `{"bones": {...}, "morphs": {...}, "props": {...}}` dict layered on top of
  the named presets (applied last, so overrides always win). `id` defaults
  to `f"{pose}__{expression}"` (sanitized) and disambiguates repeated
  pose+expression pairs with different overrides.

## Running

```bash
# Validate the spec and see the expanded work plan without touching either server:
python main.py --spec spec.json --dry-run

# Full run: render then stylize every combo x camera:
python main.py --spec spec.json

# Iterate on ComfyUI prompt/LoRA tuning without re-rendering Daz:
python main.py --spec spec.json --stage stylize --force

# Debug a single failed combo:
python main.py --spec spec.json --combo combat_ready__angry --camera front --force
```

Exit code is `0` if every combo x camera succeeded or was skipped, `1` if
any failed -- but the run never aborts partway through a large matrix
(failures are logged and the run continues), except a failed scene-baseline
restore between combos, which aborts the whole run since a broken baseline
could silently corrupt every subsequent combo.
