derivation from the beauty render.

Iray Canvas outputs must be tonemapped to 8-bit PNG before upload. The third
ControlNet conditioning pass is Canny/lineart derived locally from the beauty
render via OpenCV rather than MaterialID (stock ControlNet models don't
understand DAZ's per-material-ID color palette).
